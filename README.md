# ProjectCV
Project Computer Vision for my Studies @ IU International University 

The Goal of this project was to detect if people keep the social distance and if not, check if they wear face masks. 

The program was implemented like the following:
- People Detection: YOLOv8
- Face Detection: face-detection library
- Mask Detection: Transfer Learning models of MobileNet and ResNet 

Because the main part of this project was to write a project report and deliver the resulting video, I will do the ReadMe anytime else when there is more time for making things more beautiful :)  

Just note that this is merely my template for the CV Project.
The directories added in this repository are empty because of size restrictions, but the main code can be found here.


I am always happy to receive feedback :)
